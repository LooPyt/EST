# Instructions

You have to test the class `StatsAnalyzer`, as thoroughly as possible, considering all the techniques that we have seen
in class so far. Mock the dependencies (using Mockito). Mock only what needs to be mocked.

Automate the test cases as **JUnit5** test methods, by filling in the example test class located in the folder
`src/test/java/zest`.

You find the implementation of the class in the folder `src/main/java/zest`.
