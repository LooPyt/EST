# Instructions

You have to test the class `CatFactsRetriever`, as thoroughly as possible, considering all the techniques that we have seen in class so far.

Also are there parts of the code that should be tested using **test doubles**? If not, motivate why in a `.md` file that
you add to the test folder;  if yes, also implement tests with doubles. If you think test doubles should be used, but
the current implementation  does not allow you to do it cleanly, propose a refactoring of the class  and test the
refactored code (make sure that  the refactored code does not change the way in which the implementation  behaves!)

Automate the test cases as **JUnit5** test methods, by filling in the example test class located in the folder
`src/test/java/zest`.

You find the implementation of the class in the folder `src/main/java/zest`.
